# Ansible collection: `foundata.proxmox`

This repository contains the `foundata.proxmox` Ansible Collection.

It provides resources to manage and different Proxmox products:

* [Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview)
* [Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/overview)
* [Proxmox Datacenter Manager (PDM)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-datacenter-manager/overview)
* [Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-mail-gateway/overview)

⚠ Please note: The features, roles, and modules in this collection are stable and tested, but the **collection is still evolving and not yet fully feature-complete**. We recommend checking that the features and products you need are currently supported before use.<br> We decided to release this collection earlier than usual because we think the available functionality is already useful and worth sharing with the community.
