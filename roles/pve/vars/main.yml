# Internal role variables and values that must NOT be overridden by the user.
#
# Variables defined here usually override earlier definitions due to the high

# List of facts used by the role (gathered on a best-effort basis if needed).
#
# To identify which subset a fact belongs to during development, you can use
# the following snippet:
#
# - ansible.builtin.setup:
#     gather_subset:
#       - '!min'
#       - '<subset_name, see parameter doc for details>'
__pve_proxmox_used_facts:
  # from subset "distribution"
  - "distribution"
  - "distribution_major_version"
  - "distribution_version"
  - "os_family"


# List of platforms this role supports and was designed for.
#
# A warning will be issued if the list contains values and the role is executed
# on an unknown (not listed) platform, but execution will continue. Example:
#
# - name: "Fedora" # A ansible_facts value ('distribution' or 'os_family')
#   versions: # A ansible_facts value ('distribution_major_version' or
#     - "all" # 'distribution_version') or "all"
# - name: "Ubuntu"
#   versions:
#     - "22.04"
#     - "24.04"
# - name: "RedHat"
#   versions:
#     - "all"
# - name: "Debian"
#   versions:
#     - "all"
__pve_proxmox_supported_platforms:
  - name: "Debian"
    versions:
      - "13"


# List of package names to be installed when run_proxmox_state is
# set to "present".
# See https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_Proxmox_VE_on_Debian_13_Trixie
__pve_proxmox_packages_install:
  - "proxmox-default-kernel"
  - "proxmox-ve"
  - "postfix"
  - "open-iscsi"
  - "chrony"


# List of package names to be uninstalled when run_proxmox_state is
# set to "absent". This variable is useful when __pve_proxmox_packages_install
# contains packages that are required for the managed software to function but
# should not be removed during uninstallation, as doing so could break other
# software. This is usually the case if there are common dependencies like
# "curl" or "openssl" which typically should remain installed even after
# uninstalling the software managed by this role.
__pve_proxmox_packages_uninstall:
  - "proxmox-default-kernel"
  - "proxmox-ve"


# List of package names to be removed unconditionally before installation
# (e.g., to prevent conflicts or resolve incompatibilities).
__pve_proxmox_packages_removal: []


# List of paths of files and directories to be removed unconditionally after
# installation. This is useful for removing default configuration resources
# that would otherwise create confusion or conflict with custom configurations
# managed by this role.
__pve_proxmox_paths_removal: []


### Override defaults of dependencies used by this role (if any).
