        description: |
          Switch to control whether temporary disaster-safeguard backups of
          important configuration files should be created before re-writing them
          via Ansible.

          When set to `true` (which is the default), the role will:

          1. Create a temporary directory with the `ansible_pve_backup_` prefix.
          2. Copy important configuration files there before editing them.

          This is only a disaster safeguard. If the automatic configuration
          causes an error, you can log in to the machine and restore the
          original configuration files from that backup. The role outputs where
          the backups are copied to.

          There is no role-based cleanup of these backup files, but the
          temporary directory is usually cleaned up by the operating system
          during boot. The backup files are typically just a few kilobytes in
          size, so keeping them around until the next reboot should not be an
          issue.

          When set to `true` (which is the default), the role will:

          1. Check for CPU vendor based IOMMU support.
          2. Add or remove needed GRUB parameters based on CPU vendor and IOMMU
             support.

      pve_proxmox_net_altnames:
        description: |
          List of network interface alternative name definitions for systemd
          link files (`/etc/systemd/network/10-*.link`).

          Instead of renaming kernel network devices, this approach assigns
          alternative names (altnames). This preserves the original device name
          assigned by the kernel and avoids potential kernel/udev conflicts
          during boot or device hotplug.

          Each entry generates a separate `.link` file named after the first
          altname (e.g., `10-main1.link`). The systemd-networkd service uses
          these files to match interfaces by MAC address and type, then applies
          the specified alternative names.

          Use `ip -br link show` to display current interface names and their
          altnames after configuration.

              Interface type identifier used for matching in the `[Match]`
              section of the generated systemd link file.

              This value is mapped to the corresponding systemd `Type=` value:

              - `en`: Ethernet (`ether`)
              - `lo`: Loopback (`loopback`)
              - `wl`: Wireless LAN (`wlan`)
              - `ww`: Wireless WAN (`wwan`)
              - `ib`: InfiniBand (`infiniband`)

              The type ensures the link file only matches interfaces of the
              correct hardware type, preventing accidental mismatches when
              MAC addresses are reused or spoofed.

              MAC address of the network interface in colon-separated format.

              Used in the `[Match]` section to uniquely identify the physical
              interface. The MAC address must match exactly for the link file
              to apply.

              Format: `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` (case-insensitive)

              Example: `3c:fd:fe:de:97:38`

              Use `ip link show` or `cat /sys/class/net/*/address` to find
              the MAC addresses of installed interfaces.

              Rendered as the `Description=` directive in the `[Link]` section.
              Use this to document the physical location, purpose, or original
              kernel name of the interface for easier identification.

              Example: `enp134s0f0np0 (dual-port NIC, upper port farther from

              Each name is rendered as a separate `AlternativeName=` directive
              in the `[Link]` section. The first entry is also used as the
              filename for the generated link file (e.g., `10-main1.link`).

              Alternative names allow referencing the interface by a
              human-friendly, predictable name while preserving the original
              kernel-assigned name. Multiple altnames can be specified if the
              interface should be reachable under different names.

              Naming conventions:
                - `main1`, `main2`: Primary workload interfaces (bond members)
                - `admfb`: Admin fallback interface (emergency access)
                - `sync1`, `sync2`: Corosync cluster communication links

              The altnames defined here should match the interface names used
              in `network_interfaces_host_specific` and related variables.

        description: |
          Cluster-wide (datacenter) firewall options applied to all PVE hosts.

          This is a passthrough of original Proxmox VE firewall options. Keys
          and values are rendered directly into the `[OPTIONS]` section of
          `/etc/pve/firewall/cluster.fw`.

          Nested dictionaries are automatically converted to the PVE
          `key=value,key2=value2` format (e.g., for `log_ratelimit`).

          Common options:

          - `enable`: Enable/disable the cluster firewall (`0` or `1`,
            default: `0`)
          - `ebtables`: Enable ebtables rules cluster-wide (`0` or `1`,
            default: `1`)
          - `policy_in`: Default policy for incoming traffic (`ACCEPT`,
            `DROP`, `REJECT`, default: `DROP`)
          - `policy_out`: Default policy for outgoing traffic (`ACCEPT`,
            `DROP`, `REJECT`, default: `ACCEPT`)
          - `policy_forward`: Default policy for forwarded traffic (`ACCEPT`,
            `DROP`, `REJECT`, default: `ACCEPT`, PVE 8.3+)
          - `log_ratelimit`: Rate limiting for firewall log messages (dict with
            `enable`, `rate`, `burst` keys)

          Reference:
            https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Firewall#pve_firewall_cluster_wide_setup

        description: |
          Cluster-wide IP aliases for use in firewall rules.

          Aliases provide speakable, stable names for IP addresses and networks.
          Once defined, aliases can be referenced in rules, IP sets, and other
          aliases using the `dc/<alias_name>` syntax.

          Each alias generates a line in the `[ALIASES]` section of

          Cluster-wide IP sets for use in firewall rules.

          IP sets are reusable collections of IP addresses, networks, and
          aliases. They simplify rule management by allowing a single rule to
          match multiple addresses.

          Each IP set generates an `[IPSET <name>]` section in
          `/etc/pve/firewall/cluster.fw`.

          Reference IP sets in rules using the `+dc/<ipset_name>` syntax
          (note the `+` prefix).

          This promotes rule reuse and simplifies management.

          Each security group generates a `[group <name>]` section in

          This is a passthrough of original Proxmox VE firewall options. Keys
          and values are rendered directly into the `[OPTIONS]` section of
          `/etc/pve/nodes/<hostname>/host.fw`.

          These options only affect the specific node, not the entire cluster.

          Common options:

          - `enable`: Enable/disable the host firewall (`0` or `1`)
          - `log_level_in`: Log level for incoming traffic
          - `log_level_out`: Log level for outgoing traffic
          - `log_nf_conntrack`: Log nf_conntrack messages (`0` or `1`)
          - `ndp`: Allow NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) for IPv6 (`0` or `1`,
            default: `0`)
          - `nf_conntrack_allow_invalid`: Allow invalid conntrack states
            (`0` or `1`, default: `0`)
          - `nf_conntrack_helpers`: Enable conntrack helpers (`0` or `1`)
          - `nf_conntrack_max`: Maximum conntrack table entries
          - `nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established`: TCP established timeout
          - `nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_syn_recv`: TCP SYN received timeout

          Node-specific firewall rules for this PVE host.

          Rules defined here only apply to this specific node, not the entire

          `/etc/pve/nodes/<hostname>/host.fw`.

          The data structure is identical to `pve_proxmox_fw_cluster_rules`.

      pve_proxmox_datacentercfg:

          Proxmox VE datacenter-wide configuration settings.

          This variable defines cluster-wide defaults rendered to
          `/etc/pve/datacenter.cfg`. Since this file resides on pmxcfs (the
          FUSE-backed cluster filesystem synchronized via Corosync), settings
          apply to all nodes in the cluster.

          This is a passthrough of original Proxmox VE datacenter options. Keys
          and values are rendered directly as `key: value` lines into
          /etc/pve/datacenter.cfg. Nested dictionaries are automatically converted to the PVE
          `key=value,key2=value2` format.

      pve_proxmox_storage:
        description: |
          List of storage definitions for the PVE host.

          This variable manages operating system-level storage configuration
          including ZFS pools, ZFS datasets, and NFS mounts. Each entry defines
          a storage resource with its type-specific attributes.

          Supported storage types:

          - `zpool`: ZFS storage pool (creates new pools from raw disks)
          - `zfs_dataset`: ZFS dataset/filesystem (creates datasets within
            existing pools, supports encryption)
          - `nfs`: NFS network mount

          The role performs extensive validation before creating storage:
          - Verifies disk existence and accessibility
          - Checks for existing data on disks (safety check)
          - Validates vdev disk counts match RAID requirements
          - Detects disks belonging to different pools

          For ZFS pools, the role will NOT automatically destroy existing data.
          Set `storage_force_cleanup: true` to allow automatic disk wiping
          (DESTRUCTIVE - use with extreme caution).

          Example:
          ```yaml
          pve_proxmox_storage:
            # ZFS mirror pool on SSDs
            - name: "pool1"

                  Each vdev defines a RAID configuration with its member disks.
                  Multiple vdevs can be combined for additional capacity (striped

                    - `autoexpand`: Auto-expand pool when larger disks added
                      (`on`/`off`)
                    - `autoreplace`: Auto-replace failed disks (`on`/`off`)
                    - `failmode`: Behavior on write failure
                      (`wait`/`continue`/`panic`)

                description: |
                  ZFS dataset properties (for `zfs_dataset` type).

                  These properties configure the dataset's behavior, performance
                  characteristics, and optional encryption. This is a passthrough
                  of original ZFS dataset properties.

                  Common properties:

                  Storage behavior:
                    - `mountpoint`: Where to mount the dataset (e.g., `/mnt/data`)
                      Use `none` for unmounted datasets (e.g., zvol parents)
                    - `compression`: Compression algorithm (`on`, `off`, `lz4`,
                      `zstd`, `gzip-N`)
                    - `atime`: Update access time on read (`on`/`off`). Disable
                      for performance.
                    - `recordsize`: Maximum block size (`128K` default, `1M` for
                      large files)
                    - `quota`: Maximum size limit (e.g., `100G`)
                    - `reservation`: Guaranteed minimum space (e.g., `50G`)

                  Metadata handling:
                    - `xattr`: Extended attribute handling (`on`, `off`, `sa`).
                      Use `sa` (system attribute) for performance.
                    - `acltype`: ACL type (`off`, `posix`, `nfsv4`)
                    - `dnodesize`: Dnode size (`legacy`, `auto`, `1k`-`16k`)

                  Encryption (native ZFS encryption):
                    - `encryption`: Encryption algorithm (`aes-256-gcm`
                      recommended)
                    - `keyformat`: Key format (`passphrase`, `raw`, `hex`)
                    - `keylocation`: Key source (`prompt`, `file:///path/to/key`)
                    - `passphrase`: The encryption passphrase (for
                      `keylocation: prompt`)
                    - `passphrase_old`: Previous passphrase(s) for key rotation
                      (string or list)

                  Note: `passphrase` and `passphrase_old` are special keys
                  handled by the role and not passed directly to ZFS.

                  Example (encrypted dataset):
                  ```yaml
                  zfs_properties:
                    mountpoint: "/mnt/secure-data"
                    compression: "on"
                    atime: "off"
                    xattr: "sa"
                    encryption: "aes-256-gcm"
                    keyformat: "passphrase"
                    keylocation: "prompt"
                    passphrase: "\{\{ vault_passphrase \}\}"
                    passphrase_old:
                      - "12345aaaaarrrrRR"
                      - "456789bbbbbbbTTT"
                  ```

                  Example (high-performance dataset):
                  ```yaml
                  zfs_properties:
                    mountpoint: "/mnt/vms"
                    compression: "lz4"
                    atime: "off"
                    recordsize: "64K"
                    xattr: "sa"
                    acltype: "off"

        description: |
          Allow automatic cleanup of existing data on disks for ZFS pool
          creation.

          DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION WARNING: When set to `true`, the role will
          automatically wipe filesystem signatures and ZFS labels from disks
          that have existing data but whose target pool does not exist.

          This is a safety mechanism. By default (`false`), the role will fail
          with detailed instructions if it encounters disks with existing data,
          allowing you to manually verify and clean the disks.

          Use cases for enabling:
            - Fresh installations where disks are known to be empty or
              recyclable
            - Automated provisioning where disk contents are irrelevant
            - Rebuilding pools after intentional destruction

          The role will NEVER automatically clean disks that:
            - Belong to a different existing ZFS pool (requires manual
              intervention)
            - Are part of an existing pool that matches the configuration

          Example:
          ```yaml
          # Enable automatic disk cleanup (DANGEROUS)
          pve_proxmox_storage_force_cleanup: true
          ```

      pve_proxmox_sm:

          Proxmox VE Storage Manager (pvesm) configuration.

          This variable defines storage resources visible in the PVE web UI and
          available for VM/container disk allocation, backups, ISO storage, and
          container templates.

          These entries configure PVE's storage layer (`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`),
          which is separate from the underlying filesystem/pool creation handled
          by `pve_proxmox_storage`. Typically, you first create the storage
          backend (ZFS pool, NFS mount, etc.) via `pve_proxmox_storage`, then
          register it with PVE via `pve_proxmox_sm`.

          Supported storage types:

          - `dir`: Directory-based storage (any mounted filesystem)
          - `zfspool`: ZFS pool/dataset storage (for zvols and datasets)

          Where:
          - `nodename|shared`: Node-local or cluster-shared storage
          - `guest`: VM/container disk storage (usually encrypted)
          - `assets`: ISOs, templates, snippets (usually not encrypted)
          - `backup`: Backup target for vzdump (usually encrypted)
          - `N`: Priority index (lower = preferred for workload type)

          Example:
          ```yaml
          pve_proxmox_sm:
            # ZFS storage for VMs/containers

                  Available content types:

                  - `images`: Virtual machine disk images (qcow2, raw, vmdk)
                  - `rootdir`: Container root directories (for LXC containers)

                  - `iso`: ISO images for VM installation
                  - `vztmpl`: Container templates (.tar.gz, .tar.xz)
                  - `snippets`: Configuration snippets (hookscripts, cloud-init)

                  Typical combinations:

              path:
                description: |
                  Filesystem path for directory storage (for `type: dir`).

                  The directory must exist and be writable. For ZFS datasets,
                  this is typically the dataset's mountpoint.

                  The role will create the directory if it doesn't exist.

                  Example: `/mnt/pool123/assets`
                type: "str"
                required: false

              # ZFS pool-specific properties
              pool:
                description: |
                  ZFS pool or dataset name (for `type: zfspool`).

                  This is the ZFS dataset path, not a filesystem path. PVE will
                  create zvols and child datasets under this location.

                  The pool/dataset must already exist. Use `pve_proxmox_storage`
                  with `type: zpool` or `type: zfs_dataset` to create it.

                  Example: `pool123/vms` or `tank/proxmox/guests`
                type: "str"
                required: false

              sparse:
                description: |
                  Enable thin provisioning for ZFS zvols (for `type: zfspool`).

                  When `true`:
                    - Zvols only consume space for written data
                    - VM disks appear full-sized but use less actual space
                    - Risk of overcommitment if total allocated exceeds pool

                  When `false`:
                    - Zvols pre-allocate their full size immediately
                    - Guaranteed space availability
                    - No overcommitment risk

                  Thin provisioning is generally recommended for efficiency but
                  requires monitoring pool usage to avoid space exhaustion.

              blocksize:
                description: |
                  ZFS block size (volblocksize) for new zvols
                  (for `type: zfspool`).

                  Determines the minimum allocation unit for VM disk writes.
                  Optimal value depends on workload:

                  - `4k`/`8k`: Database workloads, random I/O
                  - `16k`: General purpose (good default)
                  - `32k`/`64k`: Sequential workloads, large files
                  - `128k`: Maximum, for mostly sequential large-file access

                  If omitted, uses the pool's default recordsize.

                  Example: `16k`
                type: "str"
                required: false
